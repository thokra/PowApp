Why a GUI?
----------
Pow makes it really easy to set up servers if you're used to the terminal or symlinking and browsing hidden folders. But for many designers (at least those i work with), it's not the case. So after using Pow for a while, I put this together so that they I work with, that don't enjoy working in the terminal could add applications from a simple interface.

Why write it?
-------------
Well, needed a project to learn MacRuby, and this helps some of the guys at work. So the code doesn't look that nice yet, but it works, at least here. So if you have any trouble, just tell me :)
