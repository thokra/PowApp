PowApp
======
PowApp is a graphical interface for [Pow](http://pow.cx)

Why a GUI?
----------
Pow makes it really easy to set up servers if you're used to the terminal or symlinking and browsing hidden folders. But for many designers (at least those i work with), it's not the case. So after using Pow for a while, I put this together so that they I work with, that don't enjoy working in the terminal could add applications from a simple interface.
